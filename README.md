Project Overview
==============================
The Objective of My Garden, Your Garden is to allow neighbors to buy, sell and trade fresh fruits and vegetables from their home gardens. 

Concept:
1. User has ripe produce in excess of what she can use herself, so she registers with us and posts her produce, quantity available and price along with a photo.

2. Users on the platform who want to purchase produce locally from their neighbors can search for items, then pull up a map showing sellers near them who have this item for sale.

3. Upon placement of an order, seller will receive a text message from the application stating. "Order has been placed for XXX items, Pickup requested at 5pm tonight."
